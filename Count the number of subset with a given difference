Approach:

Whenever, encounter a new question try to find its related questions.
In this question we have to find count the no of subsets with a given difference, let's simplify this into a well known problem

sum(s1) - sum(s2) = diff --eq1;
sum(s1) + sum(s) = SUM(arr) ----eqn2;


summing both equations, we get sum(s1) = (diff + sum(arr))/2 ;

Now this is converted into count no of subsets with given sum
so always try to think the question with solved questions 

code:
same as subset sum, just add few lines to for above one;
